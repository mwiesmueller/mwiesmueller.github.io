<h3>A history from me and my profession...</h3>

<p>Hello ...</p>

<p>my name is Martin and i come frome the small town called Forchheim near N端rnberg. My job history begins with an education to car mechanic on a middlesize car garage in 2001. With this education i've transfer my hobby to my job.</p>

<p>
After this i got the qualification to master craftsman in 2004. With this qualification i've took the job of the managment position in this car-garage.
</p>

<p>
An additional hobby was IT techniques and software development at this time. So i've give the maintanance and service of my companys IT infrastructure, too. Additional i've developed a web based processmanagement tool for car garages in my private time. With this tool it was possible to manage tires and contracts. The technology used at that time was HTML, PHP, MySql on an internal hosted apache webserver.
</p>

<p>
I've study software development never again. So i had to teach my self in my leisure time. Through this balance act in my job history it's very easy for me to understand the requirements of car garage software.
</p>

<p>
That's the reason why i took up a job at the supportcenter of an IT company who's called WERBAS AG near Stuttgart in Germany. This company is a software provider who provides special software for car garages and dealers. I think this was the perfect place to further develop my knowledge of IT and processes in car garages. Because of my history the systems Microsoft SQL and .NET were no foreign words for me. A short time later i took up the job to manage special fields in this department.
</p>

<p>
The world wide web is my passion. Because of this i've tried different exmpiriments to design different car garage processes on a mobile device. The keyword was: "direct acceptance" - a workshop process who takes place direct on customers car. Because of this i've build together with a colleague some mockups to test this expiriments. The first MockUps we've developed in HTML5 an PHP. The expierience of this we introduce the managment chief of the company.
</p>

<p>
After that the company founded and monied a team for this area to develop a new product. A new workgroup who's called "Web Team" was founded, too. At this time my assignemt changed complete. We started to develop the new product based on a MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS). The same language on front- and backend was very important for us. The expierience in this languages i've took up on different coachings and on different calls (EnterJS, Angular Days a.s.o). Meanwhile it's very easy for me to work with this languages.
</p>

<p>
So little team of 3 persons finished to develop a web based application connected to the existing WERBAS application. The main target in this development was mobil first, good handling, fast installation and device independence. A new payment process with online payment provider is integrated in this system architecture, too. As interfaces we used a RESTful API in all our systems.
</p>

<p>
This architecture was permanently further developed. I'm the key figure for design and development in this case. In addition to the development in the area of Angular, we changed the container- and scalingservice to Kubernetes in the backend, very soon. In addition, we also implemented a Microservice architecture with NodeJS, Seneca and RabbitMQ.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least. On first postion in hole of my life is my wife and my childrens. Without their, my history would not be possible.
